## Bernoulli regression

*In the 1996 presidential elections in the USA, Bill Clinton ran against Bob Dole. farawayâ€™s nes96 are the results
of a poll, along with a range of predictors.*

### Load the data and look at the summary of it.


```{r}
library("faraway")
library("ggplot2")
data("nes96")
```


### Plot vote as a function of population density.


```{r}

plot(vote ~ log(popul+1), data=nes96)

```

### Fit a GLM to represent this relationship


```{r}

fm <- glm(vote ~ log(popul+1), data=nes96, family=binomial)
summary(fm)

```
*Yes it is: the response variable is internally coded as Clinton=0, Dole=1 (in alphabetical sequence). Hence the slope
estimate is of the probability of 1 (i.e. voting Dole) as affected by population density.*
